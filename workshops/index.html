                        This is one of the important tool for solving the current industrial mechanical problems in machines and any dynamic objects that are in contact with the fluids (liquid or air). To make the sustainable design and efficient design we should test our model for the effect of fluids.</br>

						Aerodynamics is also one of the branch of fluid dynamics so for all the high speed moving objects we should know the effect of pressure, velocity and problems arising because of the force of the fluid.<br/>

						In 2 days workshop students will learn the concept of Fluid dynamics and how to solve the fluid dynamics problems with the help of Ansys software with no of projects.<br/><br/>

                        The Internet of things (stylised Internet of Things or IoT) is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. In 2013 the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) defined the IoT as "the infrastructure of the information society." The IoT allows objects to be sensed and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit.When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.

                        <b>Game Development</b><br/>
						Due to constant rise of the video game industry, the demand for game developers is increasing at a steadfast rate. The Game Development Workshop will impart participants with the knowledge of the tools and techniques needed for design and development of games. This intensive two-day workshop will explore the day-to-day craft of game design through hands-on activities, group discussion, analysis, and critique. The training focus is to enable participants to develop interactive games using JavaScript and C# with the help of live projects.<br/><br/>
						
						<b>Google Summer of Code</b><br/>
						The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program, first held from May to August 2005, in which Google awards stipends (of US$5,500, as of 2016) to all students who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over.<br/>
						
						The program invites students who meet their eligibility criteria to post at most 5 applications that detail the software-coding project they wish to work on. These applications are then evaluated by the corresponding mentoring organization. Every participating organization must provide mentors for each of the project ideas received, if the organization is of the opinion that the project would benefit from them. The mentors then rank the applications and decide among themselves which proposals to accept. Google then decides how many projects each organization gets taking into account the number of applications the organization has received, and asks the organizations to mark at most that many projects accordingly.<br/>

In the event of a single student being marked in more than one organization, Google mediates between all the involved organizations and decides who "gets" that student. The other mentoring organization then unmarks the student and marks a new proposal for acceptance, or gives their slot back to the pool, after which it is redistributed.
