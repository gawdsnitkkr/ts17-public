            Techspardha may be just technical fest for some but we as a team see it as a fest which relates with the all around 
            upliftment of the society.Being an elite technical institution in the state it is our sole responsibility to mend the 
            stereotypes in the society.<br>
            Being  technical grads does not mean an end to our  zeal, since inception we have strived for a more substantial 
            cause. India has a great gender demography at present with 60% of youth population. What we need is to have a society 
            free of prejudices, social stigmas and other stereotypes towards women which has engulfed the present generation 
            ultimately leading to its annihilation. ‘She Save her’ and  ‘Make A Wish’ are some of the social campaigns that targets 
            amelioration of the women’s perception  and children condition in India particularly Haryana which is socially lagging
            in women empowerment.

                citizens aware of the female conditions in the society and to eradicate the gender discrimination and female 
                foeticide in the society.
